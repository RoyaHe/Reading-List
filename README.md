# Reading List
By [Roya He](https://royahe.github.io) (yunjie.he.17@ucl.ac.uk), this repository contains some informative papers and blogs on ML (Machine Learning) and NLP (Natural Language Processing). They are classified based on their themes. More interesting contents will be uploaded soon! Any recommendations are highly appreciated!
